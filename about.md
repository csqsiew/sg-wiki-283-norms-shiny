# The Small World of Singlish Words Project

The [Small World of Singlish Words](https://singlishwords.nus.edu.sg) is our lab's ongoing efforts to develop psycholinguistic research resources for Singapore English. Singapore English is known for its unique vocabulary of words like  *shiok*, *diam*, *sian*, and *chope*. But unfortunately we don't have much lexical information for these words.

In this project, we collected affective-semantic ratings for a set of 283 Singlish words and concepts from native speakers of Singapore English. You can think of these ratings as your emotional or mental responses when viewing a Singlish concept. For instance, the word *shiok* elicits highly positive, arousing emotions, but is not a particularly concrete or funny concept. In contrast, Singaporeans find the word *botak* to be highly concrete and funny :) 

These data can be used for inferring sentiment of text or language generated by Singapore English speakers which can have various natural language processing applications in industry. 

## A map of Singapore English

In a different project, we are also collecting word associations for uniquely Singaporean words and concepts so that we can build the first cognitive language network of Singapore English words. Here is a rudimentary network of the word ["shiok"](https://thehomeground.asia/wp-content/uploads/shiokjs.html).  

If you consider yourself a native speaker of Singapore English, we would like to invite you to participate in our citizen science research study. Simply click [here](https://singlishwords.nus.edu.sg) and begin! Thank you in advance for your contributions to science :)
