# R Shiny Application to Explore Singlish Norms 

This application is an accompaniment to our research developing lexical-semantic norms for Singapore English. It features the definitions, valence, arousal, concreteness, and humor of 283 common Singlish words and concepts. 

Feel free to pull this repo and run the R Shiny application locally in your computer. Otherwise, you can also view a demo of this application [here](http://r-server.csqsiew.xyz/sgnorms/). 

## Running Locally

```
shiny::runGitHub(repo="sg-wiki-283-norms-shiny", username="csqsiew")
```

Alternatively, you can download the repository and run app.R.

## Dataset
